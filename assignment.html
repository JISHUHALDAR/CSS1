    CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
</h2>
   <ul class="test2">
<li>
    Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1
</li>
<li>
    Internal - by using a stle element in the headsection
</li>   
<li>
    External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file. 
</li>
<li>
    The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="bg">
        in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,
    </span>because this is easier to demonstrate. and easier for you to try it yourself. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    When companies CSS class vs ID. the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the othetr hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also
    special in that you can use a special URL to link to an element and it's used by Javascript.
</p>
<p>
    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been target, a style or set of style can be applied to the
    element.
</p>
<p>
    There is a wide range of selectors availaable. Two of the most commonly used are class used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
